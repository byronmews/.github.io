I am currently a bioinformatician within the GOSH Bioinformatics group working alongside clinical bioinformaticians on software development and analytical projects to improve the genomic diagnostic service.

I have over ten yearsâ€™ experience in high-throughput sequencing from doctoral training, research, and public health roles, including the Sanger Institute, Medical Research Council, and Public Health England, enabling a wide analytical and applied skill set in the genomics space, coupled to a strong molecular biology research background.
