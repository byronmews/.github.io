I am currently a bioinformatician embedded within an NHS molecular pathology lab working on the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project.

I have over ten yearsâ€™ experience in high-throughput sequencing from doctoral training, research, and public health roles, including the Sanger Institute, Medical Research Council, and Public Health England, enabling a wide analytical and applied skill set in the genomics space, coupled to a strong molecular biology research background.
